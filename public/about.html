   <p>
    Prior to my role at Capgemini, where I ultimately became a Senior Cyber Security Engineer and Technical Lead, I had established myself as a multi-faceted engineer with the tenacity and determination to shine in any industry and using any languages and technologies. After joining Capgemini, I really honed my skills in cyber security, Linux administration, application development, CI/CD strategy, and technical leadership. I now have a proven track record of providing innovative solutions to achieve company goals, developing and deploying desktop and web applications, designing processes and procedures, mentoring junior engineers, and facilitating formal training for other colleagues.
    <br><br>
    With over 16 years of experience across a variety of disciplines and technologies, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to any team!
